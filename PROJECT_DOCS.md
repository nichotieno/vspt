    1.  Setup Next.js project with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and ShadCN.
    2.  Implement database schema using SQLite and `better-sqlite3`.
    3.  Develop user authentication (signup, login, profile management).
    4.  Integrate Finnhub API for stock data (quotes, profiles, news).
    5.  Build core trading logic (buy/sell actions, cash management).
    6.  Develop UI for Dashboard, Stock Detail, Portfolio, and Watchlist.
    7.  Implement performance charts for portfolio history and stock prices.
    8.  Integrate Genkit for AI-powered stock note generation.
    9.  Write unit and component tests using Jest and React Testing Library.
    10. Dockerize the application for deployment.
    11. Set up a CI workflow using GitHub Actions.
  - **Responsibilities**: All development and implementation tasks are handled by the AI Prototyper.
  - **Timeline & Milestones**:
    - **Milestone 1**: Basic project setup and database schema.
    - **Milestone 2**: User authentication and core data fetching.
    - **Milestone 3**: Trading functionality and portfolio management.
    - **Milestone 4**: UI/UX implementation and visualization.
    - **Milestone 5**: AI feature integration.
    - **Milestone 6**: Testing, Dockerization, and CI setup.
  - **Deliverables**: A complete web application matching the project scope.

- **Kickoff Document**: Not applicable for this development process.

## ðŸ”¹ 2. **Technical Documentation**

- **Architecture Document**
  - **System Design Overview**: The application is a full-stack web app built on the Next.js App Router. It leverages React Server Components for performance and server-side data fetching. Server Actions are used for data mutations (e.g., buying/selling stock) to avoid the need for separate API endpoints. A SQLite database handles data persistence, and all GenAI functionality is managed through Genkit flows.
  - **Component Interaction Diagrams**:
    - `User` -> `Login/Signup Page` -> `AuthContext` -> `Server Actions` -> `Database`
    - `User` -> `Dashboard/Stock Page` -> `PortfolioContext` -> `Server Actions` & `Finnhub API`
    - `User` -> `AI Note Feature` -> `Genkit Flow` -> `Google AI`
  - **Technology Stack**:
    - **Framework**: Next.js (with App Router)
    - **Language**: TypeScript
    - **UI**: React, ShadCN UI, Tailwind CSS
    - **AI**: Genkit, Google AI (Gemini)
    - **Database**: SQLite (via `better-sqlite3`)
    - **Charting**: Recharts
    - **Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library
    - **Containerization**: Docker
    - **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions

- **Design Specifications**
  - **UI/UX**: The design follows a clean, data-focused layout with a modern aesthetic.
    - **Primary Color**: Strong Blue (`#2962FF`)
    - **Background Color**: Light Grey (`#F5F7FA`)
    - **Accent Color**: Soft Purple (`#A663CC`)
    - **Font**: 'Inter' (sans-serif)
    - **Layout**: The UI is responsive, with clear sections for portfolio, watchlist, and stock details. It uses cards, tables, and charts to present information effectively.

- **Code Documentation**
  - **`README.md`**: The repository includes a `README.md` file with detailed instructions for installation, configuration (`.env.local`), and running the application locally.
  - **Inline Code Comments**: Key files (`/src/app/actions.ts`, `/src/lib/db.ts`, `/src/contexts/*.tsx`, etc.) contain JSDoc-style comments explaining the purpose of functions, their parameters, and return values.
  - **API Docs**: Not applicable, as the application uses Server Actions instead of a REST/GraphQL API. External API usage (Finnhub) is documented in `/src/lib/finnhub.ts`.

- **Database Schema**
  - **Tables**:
    - `users`: Stores user information, credentials, and cash balance.
    - `portfolio`: Holds the user's current stock holdings (one row per ticker).
    - `transactions`: A log of all buy and sell transactions.
    - `watchlist`: Stores the tickers the user is watching.
    - `portfolio_history`: Records snapshots of the user's total portfolio value over time.
  - **Relationships**: All data tables (`portfolio`, `transactions`, `watchlist`, `portfolio_history`) are linked to the `users` table via a `user_id` foreign key with a `CASCADE` delete rule.

- **Infrastructure & Deployment Guide**
  - **Hosting**: The application is designed to be hosted in any environment that supports Node.js and can run a Docker container (e.g., Firebase App Hosting, Vercel, Google Cloud Run).
  - **CI/CD**: A GitHub Actions workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. It triggers on pushes and pull requests to the `main` branch and executes linting, type checking, tests, and a Docker build to ensure code quality and a buildable state.
  - **Deployment**:
    1. Build the Docker image: `docker build -t stocksim-app .`
    2. Run the container, passing the API key: `docker run -p 9002:9002 -e FINNHUB_API_KEY="your_api_key" stocksim-app`

## ðŸ”¹ 4. **Testing & Quality Assurance**

- **Test Plan**
  - **Testing Strategy**: A hybrid approach combines server-side unit tests for business logic and client-side component tests for UI interactions.
  - **Scope**:
    - **Unit/Integration Tests**: Server Actions (`/src/app/actions.ts`) are tested to ensure database operations and business logic are correct.
    - **Component Tests**: Key pages like Login, Signup, and Dashboard are tested to verify rendering, user interactions, and state changes.
  - **Tools**: Jest is the test runner, with React Testing Library and `@testing-library/user-event` used for component testing.

- **Test Cases & Results**:
  - Test case definitions can be found in the `*.test.ts` and `*.test.tsx` files within the `/src/app/` directory.
  - Tests are run automatically via the CI pipeline on every push.

- **Bug Report Summary**: No major bugs are currently tracked.
